# Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV

This project performs real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier. It captures video from your webcam and detects human faces by drawing rectangles around them.

## 🛠️ Features

- Real-time face detection
- Webcam integration
- Uses Haarcascade pre-trained models

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Solitaryseeker/Face-Recognition/blob/main/Face%20Recognition.ipynb
   cd face-detection-opencv


#🧠 Model Used
This project uses Haar Cascade Classifier – a pre-trained face detection model provided by OpenCV.

##📦 What is Haar Cascade?
Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based object detection algorithm used to identify objects in images or video. It was proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in 2001.

OpenCV provides many pre-trained classifiers for detecting faces, eyes, smiles, etc. In this project, we use:
