# Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV

This project performs real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier. It captures video from your webcam and detects human faces by drawing rectangles around them.

## 🛠️ Features

- Real-time face detection
- Webcam integration
- Uses Haarcascade pre-trained models

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
